Algorithm for the Trapping Rainwater problem using the stack approach:

1.Initialize a variable, totalWater, to 0.
2.Initialize an empty stack, stack.
3.Loop through each element in the input array, heights:
 a. While the stack is not empty and the current element, heights[i], is greater than the height of the top element in the stack:
 i. Pop the top element from the stack and store its index in topIndex.
 ii. If the stack is empty, break out of the loop.
 iii. Get the index of the previous element in the stack, prevIndex, which is the new top element of the stack.
 iv. Calculate the distance between the current index and the index of the previous element in the stack, prevIndex, using the formula: distance = i - prevIndex - 1.
 v. Calculate the trapped water for the popped element using the formula: trappedWater = distance * (min(heights[i], heights[prevIndex]) - heights[topIndex]).
 vi. Add the trapped water to totalWater.
 b. Push the current index onto the stack.
4.Return totalwater.
5.You may change your input by manually changing the Heights weight before running the code.
