The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Here's an example of how we can visualize the N-Queens problem in a game format with a 4x4 board and 4 queens:
  a b c d

Each square on the board represents a position where a queen can be placed. In this example, we have placed four queens on the board so that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Now, let's say you have a specific input, such as a 5x5 board and 5 queens. Here's how we can visualize the game with this input:
