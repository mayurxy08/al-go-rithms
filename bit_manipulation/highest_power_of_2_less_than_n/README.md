## Computing the Highest power of 2 less than or equal to the given natural number N ##

Given a natural number N, output the highest power of 2<=N.

Example 1:

>Input: 2

>Output: 2

Example 2:

>Input: 5

>Output: 4

Follow up:

It is easy to come up with an O(N) solution (checking all numbers upto N) or even an O((lg(n))^2) solution (checking only powers of 2 upto N and using fast exponentiation), but can it be done in O(1)?

Hint: Try to modify the bits of the number
