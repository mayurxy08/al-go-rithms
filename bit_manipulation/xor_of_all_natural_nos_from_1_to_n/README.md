## Computing the XOR of the first N natural numbers ##

Given a natural number N, output the XOR of all natural numbers from 1 to N.

Example 1:

>Input: 2

>Output: 3

Example 2:

>Input: 5

>Output: 1

Follow up:

A naive solution (taking the XOR of all numbers from 1 to N using a for loop) would result in a time complexity of O(N). 
But can we do better?

Hint: Try to take solve the question on a paper for N = 2,3,4,5... so on. Do you see a pattern?
